# text-to-shape-aws

## This project shows how to build a simple Cloud + AI app using AWS and Python:
â€¢	Takes Free-text Input From User â†’ AWS Bedrock (Claude) â†’ JSON {shape, color}
â€¢	Pillow draws the input by only using "Basic" shapes (circle, square, etc.)
â€¢	Image stored in S3
â€¢	API returns short-lived presigned URL for security
â€¢	Secured with IAM roles, least privilege, input validation, rate limiting, and CloudWatch
â€¢ Deployed on EC2 with IAM Role, Security Groups, CloudWatch monitoring

## Architecture
1.	User sends text (/ai-draw endpoint)
2.	Flask app on EC2 calls Bedrock â†’ {shape, color}
3.	Pillow draws image locally
4.	Upload to S3
5.	Return presigned URL (10 min expiry)

## AWS Services Used
- EC2 (Flask API hosting)
- S3 (image storage with presigned URLs)
- IAM Roles (least privilege: S3 + Bedrock only)
- AWS Bedrock (Claude model for NLP â†’ command translation)
- CloudWatch (logs + CPU alarm)
- Security Groups (SSH restricted to my IP, API port limited)

## Notes
- Demo was deployed, tested, and documented with screenshots.
- Environment has been **terminated** to avoid costs (Free Tier project).
- Not done to avoid extra costs but has appropriate base: HTTPS with ALB+ACM, Docker/ECS, Route 53 custom domain.
